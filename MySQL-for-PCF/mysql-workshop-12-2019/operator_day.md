# Day Two: Operator Focus

* Opening, introductions
* **Note:** We have a single PAS foundation for these activities, so we will all need to share it, making this day a group activity.

* Install and configure MySQL tile for PCF.

* Upgrade the tile, and any service instances.

* Look at “workload profiles” (e.g. “write-heavy”, etc.), an available tuning parameter.

* Galera HA cluster
  - Create a service instance using the HA / Galera plan
  - Bind an app to this instance
  - Terminate the VM for the primary node
  - Verify the app continues to operate normally

* Monitoring
  - Access and review MySQL logs
  - Review available key performance indicators (e.g. KPIs)
  - Discuss using the audit logs

* Configure backups (note that we did this step during the installation -- it's mandatory)

* Perform a restore from backup

* Discuss MySQL Workbench for data migration
